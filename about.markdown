Hello everybody! My name's Ivan. I'm 27. I live in Moscow. It's my personal blog and I really want to share with you my interesting materials. Sometimes I want to write interesting posts about things I like. I'm a computer security specialist, but I've got a lot of hobbies. I'm into music, programming, networking, languages, games and so on. It's my first experience in writing, so don't judge me so strictly! Though I don't care! Feel like at home. Love everybody!
